		1.1.5 
- Added
Integrated Medvhe's changes on the two animations, Zweiswing and Polearm (should fix some animations)
New Zweihander Variants , I've overhauled the zweihander to now be like the other blades with differing sharpnesses, please note this will break any existing zweihanders. Also note that Gold & Silver crossguarded Zweis can only accept Sharp & Honed blades.
Sabres! Sabres have a range of 2.5m and are excellent at cutting exposed flesh, they're not so great against armoured targets however!
Killij! Killij are a shorter (2.3m) range and slightly more fragile sabre that have a harsher curve and pack a slightly harder punch.
Boar spears! At a pretty lengthy reach of 3.8m these spears allow you to hit soft-bodied targets with relative impunity. (Lower damage/Durability than ranseur)
Voulges! (Model might change later) A polearm that confers good damage at a moderate range.
*Dane Axe placeholder, model needs to be worked on

*NEW METALS! Three New Fantasy Metals as well as craftable Titanium AND Stainless Steel!
*The new metals will be fairly rare and require titanium to be able to start mining them.
*Knives, Pickaxes, Prospecting Picks for the five new metals	(will make a new model later)
*Axes, Chisels, Cleavers, Hammers, Hoe, Padlocks, Saws, Scythes, Shovels, Shears, Wrench 

- Adjusted
Bearded axe uses zweiswing not axechop (Medvhe)
Padded club's attack animation is now falx, not breaktool (Medvhe)
Shortswords damage -1 on all (Medvhe)
Nadziak uses falx anim now (Medvhe)
Nadziak Damage Slightly increased , BBronze : 2>2.5 , TBronze : 2.25>2.75 , BLBronze : 2.5>3 , Iron : 2.75>3.25 , MIron : 3>3.5 , Steel : 3.5>4 | This makes the Nadziak slightly more damaging on soft targets, the nadziak has a higher tier however and is meant to be more effective against armoured targets.
Toolrack positions for : Arming sword, Ranseur, Bec, Warscythe
Warscythe ranged increased from 2.5>2.8m

- Fixed
Oversight on bearded axe not taking damage when used for chopping wood. (Medvhe)

- Notes
*There are no new weapons OR armours under the new metals, it's strictly tools at the moment. I'm leaving this for a future update (plus I need to think on balancing)
*This update will very likely clash with certain mods, if you have a mod conflict, let me know so I can make a list!
*I need to implement an option to turn off the <spoiler> metals.
**Please note that if you remove the mod if you use this current version it *MIGHT* make the world unplayable. (I had weird issues in testing, need to test further/get feedback)
*As per above, zweihanders are reworked and any old ones will 404 it's model/texture, I apologize for this but c'est la vie. (This is an important note for server admins)
*Seax, Shortsword and Axes *might* get reworked to have Blunt/Dull/Sharp/Honed blades as well, this update was already taking too long so I didn't do such with them, please make a note of this as any/all of these three might need replacing like zweis.
*Stainless steel will require pulverized chromite, an ingot mold, lime,a steel ingot, and "manganese powder" (new item) that is crushed rhodochrosite with a STEEL hammer in the grid, I'll be making this a pulverized item as well, I was having issues with the JSON patch however so the current recipe is a temporary one, this makes a "coated steel ingot" which you put into the cementary to make stainless steel.
*Titanium Ingots require : Manganese powder, Lime, Ingot Mold and 20 ilmenite nuggets, this makes a "prepared titanium" ingot which is put into the cementary.
**If we ever get a blast furnace, the above two will be using those
*Fantasy Ores : All three currently are bloomed, this will be changed in the future, as per above, time constraints.
**On note of ores, all three are supposed to be fairly rare and I've had a nightmare of a time trying to balance them, let me know if they're unable to be found at all, or are simply too common in their appropriate stone types.
*Some of the textures for the new metals/ores need to be changed in a future update.

	PLEASE let me know of any issues, this update is changing and adding a lot of things, bugs are to be expected.
	
	
	
	
	
	
			1.1.6
		Adjusted : 
Stainless Steel prepared ingot grid recipes, (no longer requires steel ingot)
Renamed "Chromite & Manganese Coated Steel Ingot" to "Prepared Stainless Steel Ingot" , please note that any existing "Chromite & Manganese Coated Steel Ingot"s will 404 and stop working
A few textures, mostly fantasy metals.
Removed a few old files
Some parts of tools and weapons
Padded Cudgel range 1.5>2m
Gave whetstones a stack size of 8, up from 1
Whetstones can now be stacked like ingots, also shelvable and display caseable now as well!
Arming sword range 2.8>2.5m , Model's Blade reduced in length
Kilij damage increase by 0.3 across the board.
Sabre range 2.5>2.4m (reduced by 0.1m) , Damage increase by 0.3 across the board.
Arming Sword Recipe - Smaller


		Added
Big bomb, Large bomb, Giant bomb and Big Bertha - The big and Large bombs have recipes (disabled by default, enable on servers at your own risk of griefing!) , Big bertha is admin only, WARNING : this has a large blast radius and will cause lag and might crash the game/server.
Mod config (Thanks CaptainOats) , Titanium, Stainless and Fantasy are all toggleable now, want the stainless steel but not titanium or fantasy metals? That's now possible.
	Please note for the fantasy metals, this won't remove any previously generated ores, ATM the config is mostly just preventing them spawning in new chunks (Also disables anvils).
Armours! Plate, Scale, Brig, Chain for all 5 new metals.
Tunneler : A new pickaxe that digs a 1x2 (Mines the block below where you're looking) , these require metal hafts and come with less durability and mining speed compared to standard picks. (Requires steel or better haft.)
Atgeirs : An olde viking polearm, sometimes called a mail-piercer.
Prepared ingots for Mithril, Adamant and Orichal, with this addition I've removed the ability of blooming adamant and orichal, they now have to be cementaried.
Sterilized Bandage! Restores 5hp and replaces the "clean bandage" degradation from the alcohol soaked. (Config to disable if you prefer the vanilla)
Pila! A stackable javelin and can be shoved into a quiver! You can make two heads per ingot. (Need to balance damage & break chance)
Quivers! Need a place to put your arrows or pila, now you can have a full 10 slot quiver specifically for ammo!
Longswords! When an arming sword is just too short and a zwei is just too large.
Training Dummies! These offer a higher HP (300hp vs Straw Dummy 100) target practice dummy or can just be used as a decoration for a barracks/training ground.
Sledgehammers : These are a slow but trusty dusty weapon & tool, these mine a 3x3 have a 2.2m range and cannot dig Gravel, Sand, Snow or Soil.
Excavator : These are a tool that gives you a 2x3 digging pattern. These can only dig : Soil/Dirt, Sand, Gravel & Snow. (Many thanks and credits to 'Meep9834')
Warhammers : These are comparable to Nadziak, they're +1 tier off their base metal so good for pvp, and have higher damage than nadziak.



		Fixed :
	Redid saws, previous ones will be broken 404 (Apologies) but should now work with all standard saw recipes and should be more mod friendly.
	Redid hammers , previous ones will be broken, should now work for various recipes.
	Shears/Scythe name
	New Axes had an oversight, namely durability
	The new metals should now require a temperature to actually be worked.

		Todo : 
	Get feedback and adjust atgeir, pila stats, sabre, kilij, longsword stats
	Touch up mithril/adamant/orichal textures for ingots/plates
	Aithril ore textures need redoing
	Fix shovel heads, using stone head shape not metal





			1.1.7 - The Great Disabling
	Added : 
	Polski Tłumaczenie 1.1.7 : Kredyty dla "Veir"
	Khopesh : Ancient design from an ancient kingdom, only available in copper and bronze. (Off by default)
	Khopesh Mold (Off by default)
	Arrowhead Molds : Small = 6 Arrowheads costs 1 ingot , Large = 9 Arrowheads costs 1.5 Ingots
	Naginata : A moderate reach polearm with good damage. (disabled by default)
	Pollaxe & Halberd : Fairly similar polearms both of which are quite effective with decent range and damage.
	Configs to disable new armours : Fantasy / Titanium / Stainless
	Configs to disable tools : Excavator, Tunneler & Sledgehammer
	
	Adjusted : 
	Disabling fantasy does a bit more.
	Sledgehammer's ability to mine materials other than stone.
	Voulge's Model
	Sledge range 2.25>2m

	
	Fixed :
	Lang files merged
	New metal axes now have crafting.
	ModId : "Swordz" > "swordz"
	Sledge can now only mine stone in a 3x3, can still mine ore & dirt directly, this fixed the issue where the sledge was mining translocators. 
	Scales : Stainless/Titanium/Fantasy should be craftable now
	Shortswords : Do damage again.
	
	
	
	
	Todo : 

!!!!	Raise stats for durability on tunnelers higher, they're metal hafted

fix new hoe heads from being displayed as stone hoe heads, not metal. 	Fix shovel heads, using stone head shape not metal
Need to slightly improve the tunneler disabling

Raise Naginata to 3 / 3.2m?
	Aithril ore textures need redoing

lower sledge attack speed in 1.19 animation dictation , raise range back up, lower damage?
add titanium scale to handbook (disabled by vanilla)

Disabler for : Mithril bloom

Nerf Sledge more , get aithril meteors working




			

			1.1.8
	Added : 
	Русский перевод 1.1.8 за авторством IFlyingTea 
	Iron Excavator and Tunneler variants, they'll need an update to disabler and stat balancing.
	Bits can be bloomed now for Steel, Stainless Steel , Titanium and Fantasy metals, this however is off by default and not really intended, it's there as an option.
	Bits can be recycled back into prepared ingots to be re-cementaried to be reused.
	Aithril meteors require Adamant picks to mine.

	Fixed : 
	Aithril meteors are now a thing proper , disabled the ore spawning (it'll still exist, nothing bad should happen to worlds), Aithril Meteors will be fairly rare (about half as common as meteoric iron)
	Naginata being enabled shouldn't pop out an error now, maybe, should also be craftable now.

	Longstanding issue with blades losing their Xskills quality , likely missed a few, report which.


	Adjusted : 
	Sledgehammer now drops about 70% less stuff , Excavator now drops about 30% less stuff.
	Zweihander's JSON : "Blade" variant changed to "sharpness" to match variant wording with the rest of the swords.
	Cleavers : Old cleavers will be broken but the new ones can now execute gen 3+ animals as intended.
	Knives : As per above with cleavers, they'll be broken but new ones should be good for intended purposes.
	Knives : Decreased damage from titanium upwards

	Todo : 
	Add requirement of ingot for bits preparedingots , returnedstack?
    Maybe: 	Reduce "blade" quantity , reduce to generic "long/Large/Curved etc blades?"



			1.1.9 - 1.20 finally!!!
	Fixed:
	Aithril meteors are now spawning properly in the new game version.
	Leather in recipes are changed to suit the new naming conventions so everythings craftable in the new game version.
	'Class: "ItemSword" ' was causing errors so has been removed.
	Seax now does damage again.
	Weapon attacks are tied to the animation speeds so you can't spam click attacks anymore.
	Big bertha now has a shape and texture again.

	Notes:
	*Fixing things that were already broken in previous mod versions or were broken by the 1.20 game update.
